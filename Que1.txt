Que1. Explain what the simple List component does.

Ans: The simple list is a reusable functional component that displays a list of items.

It contains two components: 
1.SingleListItem 
2.WrappedListComponent

-> SingleListItem is taking in four props:
1. index
2. isSelected
3. onClickHandler
4. text

Each item of list is displayed by singleListItem, which displays the items text and changes its background color, 
when it is selected it changes it to green else it is red. SingleListItem is wrapped using memo to prevent unnecessary 
re-renders.


-> WrappedListComponent: 
1. It is a functional component which is taking an array of object as props.
2. Using map function sending the props to SingleListItem. 
3. It has a function called handleClick that takes the index as input of the selected item. This allows the selected item to be highlighted. 
4. It is also wrapped in a memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
